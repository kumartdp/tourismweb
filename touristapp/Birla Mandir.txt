Birla Mandir


The Birla Mandir in Hyderabad forms a pleasant serene atmosphere and is a perfect place for those who wish to get away from the city life and immerse themselves in prayer and meditation. Created in 1976 by Swami Renganathananda from Ramakrishna Ashram and constructed by the Birla Foundation. The Mandir is dedicated to the Lord Venkateshwara of Tirumala and is in fact modelled after and is the replica of the idol of Balaji of Tirupati.
The temple itself is located at the top of a 280 feet tall hill called the Naubat Pahad that overlooks both, Hyderabad and Secunderabad as well as the Hussain Sagar Lake and is one of the best viewpoints in the city, especially at night when the lights covering the Mandir illuminate the area and make it a beacon of hope that it is and has been since its creation.
