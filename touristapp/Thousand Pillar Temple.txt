The Thousand Pillar Temple is an ancient temple that is tucked away in a small town named Hanamakonda in the vibrant state of Telangana. As the name suggests, the temple has over one thousand pillars, some of which are a part or extension of adjacent pillars! These pillars are so tightly knit, they practically form the walls of the temple.
