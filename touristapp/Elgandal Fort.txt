Elgandal Fort

The spires of the Elgandal Fort or Elagandula Khilla stand tall into the sky, piercing their way out to narrate the stories of its glorious past from the skyline of Karimnagar. They stand proudly narrating the glories of its past to posterity. Even after facing ravages of man and nature, the Elgandal fort still stands high showing its lust for power that has been pivotal in grazing and raising dynasties. The crumbling walls of this magnificent fort still carry the stamp of every dynasty that had once embraced its illustrious portals. Despite its debauched state, the Fort still remains one of the most splendid relics of Telangana's history and a commonly visited spot in Karimnagar tourism.
